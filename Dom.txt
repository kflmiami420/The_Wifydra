Here is a quick brakdown 

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by including various libraries necessary for the project, such as SoftwareSerial (for serial communication on other digital pins), TinyGPS++ (for GPS functionality), Adafruit_ssd1306syp (for OLED display), ESP8266WiFi, espnow (for WiFi communication), and SD (for SD card functionality).

Constants and Variables: Several constants and variables are defined, such as filenames for log data, WiFi network information, and counters for the number of times certain WiFi networks are seen.

Functions:

updateFileName(): This function generates a unique log file name by incrementing a number until an available file name is found.
printHeader(): This function writes a header to the log file with column names.
OnDataRecv(): This callback function is executed when data is received via ESP-NOW. It processes the received data, extracts WiFi network details, GPS coordinates, and other information, and logs them to the SD card.
displayinfo(): This function updates and displays information on the OLED display, including GPS coordinates and the number of times certain WiFi networks are seen.
Setup(): The setup function initializes various components and functionalities. It initializes the OLED display, sets up serial communication with the GPS module, initializes SD card communication, sets the ESP-NOW role, registers the data receive callback, and calls updateFileName() and printHeader().

Loop(): The loop function repeatedly calls displayinfo() to update the display with real-time information. It also continuously updates GPS data using gps.encode(ss.read()).

smartDelay(): A custom delay function that ensures the GPS object is continuously updated during the delay period.

Please note that some portions of the code appear to be commented out, and there might be a missing or extraneous "void displayinfo();" line at the end of the OnDataRecv() function.
